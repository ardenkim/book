# Material Design

This lecture discusses [Material design](https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html): the _design language_ created by Google to support mobile user interfaces. The design language focuses on mobile designs (e.g., for Android), but can also be used across platforms (e.g., on the web through [css frameworks](https://material.io/components/web/)).
